The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent [ the Resolution Trust Corp. ] from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep [ the bailout spending ] from swelling the budget deficit .
But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain [ the bad assets ] of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately .
But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until [ the assets ] can be sold separately .
That debt would be paid off as [ the assets ] are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years .
That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving [ the total spending ] for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years .
`` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said David Cooke , executive director of [ the RTC . ]
Absent other working capital , he said S , the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling [ the bad assets . ]
[ The complicated language ] in the huge new law has muddied the fight .
Moreover , it says [ the RTC 's ] total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds .
But Congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say S opponents of [ the RTC 's ] working-capital plan , and Rep. Charles Schumer -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in not keeping Congress informed .
`` That secrecy leads to a proposal like [ the one ] from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of draconian , '' he said .
`` The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on [ the Hill ] if they want that kind of flexibility . ''
Hard on the heels of Friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and [ the uncertainty ] that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market 's just fine .

[ The new PaineWebber commercial , ] created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary Farrell , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , sounding particularly bullish .

Instead , it settled on just urging [ the clients ] who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market .
`` We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives [ the prices ] down further , '' says John Lampe , PaineWebber 's director of advertising .
With [ the market fluctuating ] and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach .
In any case , [ the brokerage firms ] are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 .
Now [ the firms ] must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around .

[ The comparable lead times ] for the Commerce index , whose components include the stock market , are far shorter -- 10 months before recessions and only three months before recoveries .
[ The Columbia economists ] also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved , had it existed , in 1929 , before the stock market crash in October that ushered in the Great Depression .
A major source of [ the recent strength ] in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate bond-price index , which is not a part of the Commerce index .
