The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having [ an RTC-owned bank or thrift ] issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
`` It 's [ a problem ] that clearly has to be resolved , '' said David Cooke , executive director of the RTC .
`` That secrecy leads to [ a proposal ] like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of draconian , '' he said .
`` The RTC is going to have to pay [ a price ] of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility . ''
Hard on the heels of Friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , [ a few big brokerage firms ] are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market 's just fine .
Hard on the heels of Friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting [ a familiar message : ] Keep on investing , the market 's just fine .
The brokerage firms learned [ a lesson ] the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic .
Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of [ a market plunge . ]
In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape [ a commercial ] after the market closed and rush it on the air that night .
Taped just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. Farrell advising , `` We view the market here as going through [ a relatively normal cycle ... . ]
But in [ a meeting ] after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad .
In 1987 , despite [ a barrage ] of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en masse .
It 's what 1 -RRB- explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than Bo Jackson ; 2 -RRB- cautions that it 's possible to drown in [ a lake ] that averages two feet deep ; and 3 -RRB- predicts that 10,000 monkeys placed before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n' roll tunes .
In game two , on [ a cool Sunday evening ] in this land of perpetual autumn , a lot of the catching up was done by the A 's catcher , Terry Steinbach .
He hit [ a 2-0 pitch ] from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1 , where it stayed .
The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9 , a.k.a. the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in [ a 5-0 decision . ]
That he was the A 's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with [ a 21-9 mark , ] plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be this week .
The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but [ a run ] and four hits in seven innings in Sunday 's contest .
He 's [ an ex-hurler ] who 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery , which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat .
He 's an ex-hurler who 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery , which looks like [ a fastball ] until it dives beneath the lunging bat .
That 's not [ an average ] to soothe Giant rooters .
[ A few folks ] even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams .
The above represents [ a triumph ] of either apathy or civility .
He was flawless afield -LRB- ditto in game two -RRB- , moved [ a runner ] along in the A 's three-run second inning , and homered for his team 's final tally .
Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for [ an autograph . ]
He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing [ a base ] and scoring a run .

NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , reflecting [ a world-wide softening ] of the computer markets .
Analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % , a good part of it coming from large orders placed by [ a few ] of NCR 's major customers .
In addition to [ a general slowing ] of the computer industry , NCR , which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers , is also affected by the retail and financial sectors , `` areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , '' notes S Sanjiv G. Hingorani , an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .
These factors , combined with [ a strong dollar , ] should negatively affect the current quarter 's results , NCR said S .
That should stop a lot of account-churning , and produce [ a stock market ] driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense .
But as the day ended in a frantic Wall Street-inspired rally , the City breathed [ a sigh ] of relief .
The Jefferies office , [ a branch ] of the Los Angeles-based firm , played it conservatively , seeking to avoid risk .
He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched [ a button ] to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes .
But the market sensed a serious buyer on [ a day ] dominated by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence .

Ambassador Paul Nitze 's statement -LRB- Notable & Quotable , Sept. 20 -RRB- , `` If you have a million people working for you , every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once [ a year , '' ] is a pretty negative way of looking at things .

LIN Broadcasting Corp. said it wo n't take [ a position ] on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. to buy LIN and has asked for clarification of the offer .

[ A group ] of institutional investors in Telerate Inc. said that Dow Jones & Co. 's $ 18-a-share offer for the electronic financial information services company is `` grossly inadequate . ''

The rationale is that [ an interruption ] of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels .

Although the union-bidder expects to patch together [ a substitute offer , ] consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending .
