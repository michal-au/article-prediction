But nobody knows at what level [ the futures and stocks ] will open today .
[ The de-linkage ] between the stock and futures markets Friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation .

Mr. Otradovec said Boeing told America West that [ the 757 ] it was supposed to get this Thursday would n't be delivered until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights , including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas .
At this point , no other America West flights -- including its new service at San Antonio , Texas ; Newark , N.J. ; and Palmdale , Calif. -- have been affected by [ the delays ] in Boeing deliveries .
America West , though , is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by [ the delayed delivery ] of a single plane than many of its competitors would be .
Though Boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday , it actually has risen over [ the last two weeks ] on the strength of new orders .
He added that the company miscalculated the union 's resolve and [ the workers ' ] disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime .

Kaufman & Broad , a home building company , declined to identify [ the institutional investors ] .
The partnership runs the risk that it may not get [ the approvals ] for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said Bruce Karatz , president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad .
Typically , developers option property , and then once they get [ the administrative approvals ] , they buy it , '' said Mr. Karatz , adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind .

To a degree , Quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of [ the so-called commodity plastics ] that pervade modern life .
At Quantum , which is based in New York , [ the trouble ] is magnified by the company 's heavy dependence on plastics .

Meanwhile , the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan 's steel quota , and made only a minor increase to [ the steel allotment ] for the European Community .
Brazil , similar to Mexico and South Korea , is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under [ the previous five-year steel quotas ] , which expired Sept. 30 .
In recent years , U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80 % of [ the 100 million tons ] of steel used annually by the nation .
Of the remaining 20 % needed , [ the steel-quota negotiations ] allocate about 15 % to foreign suppliers , with the difference supplied mainly by Canada -- which is n't included in the quota program .
It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up [ the international steel trade ] , which has been notoriously managed , subsidized and protected by governments .
In [ the recent talks ] , the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons , to 7 % of the U.S. market from 6.7 % in 1988 .
Japan , the EC , Brazil , Mexico and South Korea provide about 80 % of [ the steel ] imported to the U.S. under the quota program .

The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent , called Attack , which quickly won a 30 % stake in [ the Japanese markets ] .
When Attack hit [ the shelves ] in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % .
While the Japanese have embraced [ the compact packaging and convenience ] of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders .
But the product , which was n't as concentrated as [ the new Cheer ] , bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped .
P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite [ the convenience ] .
To be sure , Kao would n't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from [ the mighty P&G ] , which has about 23 % of the market .

In announcements to workers late last week , GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on [ the futures ] of three U.S. car factories .

The Bronx has a wonderful botanical garden , a great zoo , its own charming Little Italy -LRB- on Arthur Avenue -RRB- and , of course , [ the Yankees ] .

The company , which issued a statement on the agreement late Friday , said that $ 1 million of [ the payment ] was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $ 500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third-quarter statement .
The company 's net worth can not fall below $ 185 million after [ the dividends ] are issued .

A handful of hot retail locations , such as [ the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas ] , have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents .
That follows a more subtle decline in [ the prior six months ] , after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986 .
But , despite the recent softening , for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from [ the rental rates ] of the late 1970s , when their leases were signed .
For the first time , [ the 83-year-old justice ] finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent , rather than as a force in the high court 's majority .
Every indication is that [ the four ] are prepared to accept this new role , and the frustrations that go with it , but in different ways .
Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role , and [ the frustrations ] that go with it , but in different ways .
[ The four justices ] are no newcomers to dissent , often joining forces in the past decade to criticize the court 's conservative drift .
Now , however , as the court 's new five-member conservative majority continues to solidify , victories for [ the liberals ] are rare .
The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan , [ the last survivor ] of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren .
In [ the seven Supreme Court terms ] from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967 , the height of the Warren Court 's power , Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court .

`` Each time the court revisits an issue , the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider [ the fundamental questions ] and to rethink the result , '' he said .
He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from [ the Warren Court 's ] opinions .
[ The dissenters ] in the Warren Court , he says , appeared to be writing for the short-term , suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon .

Justice Stevens , 69 , is probably the most philosophical of [ the dissenters ] about his role , in part because he may be the least liberal of the four , but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others .

The government sold [ the deposits ] of four savings-and-loan institutions , in its first wave of sales of big , sick thrifts , but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth .
[ The four S&Ls ] were sold to large banks , as was the case with most of the 28 previous transactions initiated by the Resolution Trust Corp. since it was created in the S&L bailout legislation two months ago .
Under these deals , the RTC sells just [ the deposits ] and the healthy assets .

The RTC had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines , but [ the delays ] illustrate the tough chore facing the agency .
As a measure of [ the depths ] to which the Texas real estate market has sunk , the RTC will pay $ 3.8 billion to NCNB to take $ 750 million of bad assets .
It will also purchase $ 845 million of [ the thrift 's ] assets , with $ 1.9 billion in RTC assistance .
Royal Trustco will pay [ the RTC ] $ 25 million to assume $ 989 million in deposits .
In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will `` dramatically de-emphasize '' its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives ; cut [ the circulation ] it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ 4 to $ 55 .
In a related development , [ the news-weekly ] , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , four-color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 .
Time is following [ the course ] of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers .
But Time , as part of [ the more cost-conscious Time Warner ] , wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks .
`` What we are doing is screening out [ the readers ] who are only casually related to the magazine and do n't really read it , '' said Mr. Heinemann .
Mr. Heinemann said [ the changes ] represent a new focus in the magazine industry : a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber , or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away .

CNN executives worry that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep viewers coming back as [ the alternatives ] multiply for news and information on cable-TV .
`` [ Just the fact we 're on 24 hours ] is no longer bulletin , '' says Ed Turner , CNN 's executive vice president , news gathering -LRB- and no relation to Ted Turner -RRB- .
`` The next stage is to get beyond [ the opinion leaders ] who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , '' says Jon Petrovich , executive vice president of Headline News , CNN 's sister network .
And [ the cable-TV operators ] -- CNN 's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are .
That 's [ less than one-third the time ] that viewers watch the major broadcast networks .
[ The brief attention ] viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV channels .
It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called `` Daybreak , '' `` Daywatch , '' `` Newsday , '' and `` Newsnight , '' but [ the shows ] varied little in content , personality or look .
Accordingly , CNN is adding a world-affairs show in [ the morning ] because surveys show its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most `` differentiated '' programs in viewers ' minds , says Mr. Amos .
Accordingly , CNN is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global-news hour in [ the afternoon ] is among its most `` differentiated '' programs in viewers ' minds , says Mr. Amos .
But 70 % of [ the cable-television-equipped households ] that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. , the network discovered , so CNN wants in .
`` I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , '' says Reuven Frank , the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of [ the Huntley-Brinkley Report ] .
In August , the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill , [ the former head ] of news specials at ABC .
CNN executives hope [ the headlines ] created by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded '' programs , in the way `` 60 Minutes '' did so well for CBS .
CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with [ the networks ] .
They market cable-TV on [ the very grazing opportunities ] CNN seeks to discourage .
The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which [ the parties ] did not intend to be bound .
In [ the Pennzoil\/Texaco litigation ] , the courts found Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound ; in Arcadian Phosphates they found there was no intention to be bound .

The transaction , announced in August , included about $ 146 million in deposits at [ the five outlets ] in California 's San Joaquin Valley .
Valley Federal said Friday that it is considering whether to seek another buyer for [ the branches ] or to pursue the transaction with Imperial Corp. , which said it is attempting to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements .
In the first six months of [ the year ] it posted a net loss of $ 33.1 million .

Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it , [ even the S&L lawyers ] concede there 's little precedent to back their position .
Still , one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to entertain the notion , and [ the lawyers ] have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law .
The dismissal of [ the pending suits ] could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC 's massive legal bills , which topped $ 73 million last year .

The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of [ the Valley Ranch ] , best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team .
Sunbelt and [ the FSLIC ] argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals `` that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings nor any means to collect from any other party , including FSLIC . ''
But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and [ the FSLIC ] and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas .
But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent [ the cases ] back to federal district court in Dallas .
Charles Haworth , a lawyer for Sunbelt , says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss [ the suits ] , because Sunbelt 's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $ 2 billion when federal regulators closed it in August 1988 .

The Soviet Union reported that thousands of tons of goods needed to ease widespread shortages across the nation were piled up at ports and rail depots , and food shipments were rotting because of a lack of people and equipment to move [ the cargo ] .

PLO leader Arafat insisted on guarantees that any elections in [ the Israeli-occupied territories ] would be impartial .
In [ the occupied lands ] , underground leaders of the Arab uprising rejected a U.S. plan to arrange Israeli-Palestinian talks as Shamir opposed holding such discussions in Cairo .
The decision is the latest move in an escalating battle between [ the franchisees ] and Mr. Posner that began in August .
Friday , 42 franchisees announced the formation of an association -- called A.P. Association Inc. -- to `` preserve the integrity of [ the Arby 's ] system . ''
[ The franchisees ] , owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby 's in the U.S. , said : `` We have concluded that continued control of Arby 's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us , because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby 's system .

September 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists , and the pessimism over interest rates caused by [ the new price data ] contributed to the stock market 's plunge Friday .
After falling for three consecutive months , the producer price index for finished goods shot up 0.9 % last month , the Labor Department reported Friday , as energy prices jumped after tumbling through [ the summer ] .
Further fueling [ the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit ] , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion .
`` I think the Friday report , combined with [ the actions ] of the Fed , weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy , '' said Robert Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago .
But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by [ the new numbers ] .
All year , energy prices have skewed the producer price index , which measures changes in [ the prices ] producers receive for goods .
Energy prices then plummeted through [ the summer ] , causing the index to decline for three consecutive months .
Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in [ the months ] ahead , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain .
`` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in [ the prices ] of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained .
Passenger car prices jumped 3.8 % in September , after climbing 0.5 % in August and declining in [ the late spring and summer ] .

In a statement , Miami-based CenTrust said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent losses '' in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of [ the dividends ] .
Mr. Paul said only about $ 150 million of [ the current holdings ] are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for [ the junk bonds ] .
The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings , but CenTrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of [ the bonds ] and lack of a ready market .
In a statement Friday , Mr. Paul challenged [ the regulators ' ] decision , saying the thrift 's operating losses and `` apparent '' junk-bond losses `` have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank . ''
He also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from [ the junk bonds ] .
Mr. Paul said [ the regulators ] should instead move ahead with approving CenTrust 's request to sell 63 of its 71 branches to Great Western Bank , a unit of Great Western Financial Corp. based in Beverly Hills , Calif .
The thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off [ the bonds ] , and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate , as required under the new thrift law .
But perhaps even more remarkable , [ the three-hour-show ] , `` Wetten Dass '' -LRB- Make a Bet -RRB- , regularly wins the top slot in the country 's TV ratings , sometimes drawing as many as 50 % of West German households .

But much of what [ the Europeans ] want to protect seems every bit as cheesy as what they are trying to keep out .
So far , [ the French ] have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail .
A glance through [ the television listings ] and a few twists of the European television dial suggest one reason why .
Topping the cheese stunt , on another typical evening of fun on `` Wetten Dass , '' a contestant won a bet with [ the show 's ] host , Thomas Gottschalk , that he could identify 300 German dialects over the telephone .
If this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise [ the protectionist barriers ] , it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get .
For [ the most part ] , what 's made here stays here , and for good reason .

[ The most popular such shows ] focus on narrow national concerns .
`` The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular , with American programs second , '' says Brian Wenham , a former director of programs for [ the British Broadcasting Corp ] .
But not much money was spent on [ the shows ] , either , a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas .
In a Madrid hotel room recently , a viewer caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on Australia 's Great Barrier Reef , only to be urged by the British announcer to `` stay tuned for [ the further adventures ] of Skippy the Kangaroo . ''

British Aerospace PLC and France 's Thomson-CSF S.A. said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided-missile divisions , greatly expanding collaboration between [ the two defense contractors ] .
After two years of talks , plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for [ the companies ] to seek French and British government clearance .
The venture would strengthen [ the rapidly growing ties ] between the two companies , and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting .
Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until [ perhaps the mid-1990s ] .
The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to [ the increasing focus ] on gas exploration , '' said Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group .
Mr. Watkins said the main reason for [ the production decline ] is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada .
Nearly all of [ the crude oil ] that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's system , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal .
Mr. Lichtblau said Canada 's declining crude output , combined with [ the fast-shrinking output ] of U.S. crude , will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East .
The company said it is beginning to see some shipping-rate improvements in [ both the intergrated-steel and steel-service-center segments ] , which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter .
Predicting [ the financial results ] of computer firms has been a tough job lately .

To illustrate , Mr. Rogers said that of [ the 14 computer-related firms ] he follows , half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year 's results , and half above those results .
While the earnings picture confuses , observers say [ the major forces ] expected to shape the industry in the coming year are clearer .
Meanwhile , competition between various operating systems , which control [ the basic functions ] of a computer , spells trouble for software firms generally .
Some lagging competitors even may leave [ the personal computer business ] altogether .

Six of [ the 12 midwestern states ] have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , South Dakota and Wisconsin .
At the same time , several states in [ the South and West ] have had their own population turnaround .
Overall , though , [ the South and West ] still outpace the Northeast and Midwest , and fast-growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue .
Being successful in careers and spending [ the money ] they make are top priorities for this group .
Unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded [ the super-rich ] .
The goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest-growing income groups , [ the upper-middle class ] .
Despite their considerable incomes and assets , 40 % of [ the respondents ] in the study do n't feel financially secure , and one-fourth do n't feel that they have made it .

After its previous mayor committed suicide last year , an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects , gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into [ the town 's ] coffers for trips and retreats .
The revelations embarrassed town officials , although they argued that [ the problems ] were n't as severe as the media suggested .

The only thing Robert Goldberg could praise about CBS 's new show `` Island Son '' -LRB- Leisure & Arts , Sept. 25 -RRB- was [ the local color ] ; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework .
And [ the local expression ] for brother is `` brah , '' not `` bruddah . ''
Sorry , the show does not even have [ the one redeeming quality ] of genuine local color .
Of [ all the ethnic tensions ] in America , which is the most troublesome right now ?

If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers , would [ the water ] be quite so hot ?
It probably would , because few or none of [ the people ] upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language .
For example , [ the New York state counsel ] for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is `` like a dinosaur .
People are fast leaving [ the place ] where he is stuck . ''

Back in the 1920s , [ the play and movie versions ] of `` Abie 's Irish Rose '' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author , Anne Nichols , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain .

He has been president and chief executive officer of Amperex Electronics Corp. , a division of North American Philips Corp. , itself a subsidiary of N.V . Philips of [ the Netherlands ] .
But Senate supporters of [ the trimmer legislation ] said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital-gains tax cut .
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said he was `` confident '' that any House-Senate agreement on [ the deficit-reduction legislation ] would n't include a capital-gains tax cut .
One obvious place to attach a capital-gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill , is [ the legislation ] to raise the federal borrowing limit .
`` Although I am encouraged by [ the Senate action ] , '' said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill . -RRB- of the House Ways and Means Committee , `` it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the Senate . ''
But Republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner [ the 60 votes ] needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill .
Asked why senators were giving up so much , New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici , [ the ranking Republican ] on the Senate Budget Committee , said , `` We 're looking like idiots .
Also stricken was a fivefold increase in [ the maximum Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties ] , which would have raised $ 65 million in fiscal 1990 .
[ The approval ] of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen. Mitchell , who had proposed the streamlining .

-- Prevent companies that have made leveraged buy-outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance [ the buy-outs ] , effective Aug. 2 , 1989 .
-- Require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that [ the dividends ] are declared rather than received , effective the day after the tax bill is enacted .
The measure repeals a 50 % exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP , if the ESOP owns less than 30 % of [ the employer 's ] stock .
-- Speed up the collection of [ the payroll tax ] from large companies , effective August 1990 .
-- Withhold income taxes from [ the paychecks ] of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding .
-- Removal of [ the U.S. Postal Service 's ] operating budget from the federal budget , reducing the deficit by $ 1.77 billion .
The statistics quoted by the `` new '' Census Bureau report -LRB- garnered from 1984 to 1986 -RRB- are out of date , certainly as an average for [ the Northeast ] , and possibly for the rest of the country .
The agency said it reduced its rating on the thrift 's subordinated debt to B-2 from Ba-2 and will keep [ the debt ] under review for possible further downgrade .
The rating concern said Franklin 's `` troubled diversification record in the securities business '' was one reason for the downgrade , citing [ the troubles ] at its L.F. Rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries .

`` I 'm [ the only one ] who said there would be an October massacre , all through late August and September , '' says Mr. Granville , once a widely followed market guru and still a well-known newsletter writer .
If you 're a technician , you obey [ the signals ] .
Right now they 're telling me to get [ the hell ] out and stay out .
Over [ the next several months ] , though , he says things look bad .
`` If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in [ the portfolios ] , I would not do any buying .
`` This is the latest manifestation of [ the capacity ] of the financial community for recurrent insanity , '' says Mr. Galbraith , an economist .
`` The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in [ the hands ] of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity .

`` It takes more error now to have a major depression than back in [ the Thirties ] -- much as the financial community and the government may try . ''
Dealers `` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make [ the trade ] . ''
Regarding the Oct. 3 letter to [ the editor ] from Rep. Tom Lantos , chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing , alleging :
2 . That Mr. Lantos supported the rights of [ the witnesses ] to take the Fifth Amendment .
As I watched him on C-Span , I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights , which he quotes from the transcript of [ the hearings ] .
He used about 56 words defending [ the witnesses ' ] constitutional rights .
Unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than 5,000 words heaping scorn on [ the witnesses ] for exercising the Fifth .
Unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than 5,000 words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising [ the Fifth ] .
4 . That the Journal defends `` [ the sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse ] of the public that took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD , '' etc. and so forth .
The problem , which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles , is not [ the likes ] of Mr. Lantos , who after all is really a bit player on the stage , but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary\/judicial body .
[ The last time ] I saw a similar congressional hearing was when `` Tail Gunner Joe '' McCarthy did his work .
Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take [ the Fifth ] . ''
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude [ the inference ] where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . ''
Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take [ the Fifth ] , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter .
Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of [ the Fifth ] may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter .
He may take [ the Fifth ] in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution .
Allowing the defendant to take [ the Fifth ] in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because [ the testimony ] in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .
Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted [ the Fifth ] in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .
It was [ Friday the 13th ] , and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points .
Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez , professors of finance at the University of Miami , found evidence that the market is spooked by [ Friday the 13th ] .
In [ the '70s ] , the market took falls nine times in a row on Friday the you-know-what .
In the '70s , the market took falls nine times in a row on [ Friday the you-know-what ] .
Another study found that [ the 82 Fridays the 13th ] in the 1940-1987 period had higher than average returns -- higher even than Fridays in general , which tend to be strong days for stock prices .
On [ the only other Friday the 13th ] this year , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about four points .
Professor Kolb says the original study , titled [ Friday the 13th ] , Part VII , was published tongue-in-cheek .
`` It was -LCB- like -RCB- [ the Friday ] before Black Monday '' two years ago .
Whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not , Nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on [ the New York and American exchanges ] .
Ten points of the drop occurred during [ the last 45 minutes ] of trading .
Most of [ the complaints ] about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors .
Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle [ the volume ] of calls , rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades .
The subject is a sore one for Nasdaq and its market-making companies , which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in [ the chaos ] of the crash .
Peter DaPuzzo , head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton , declared : `` It was [ the last hour ] of trading on a Friday .
Jeremiah Mullins , [ the OTC trading chief ] at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York , said proudly that his company executed every order it received by the close of trading .
Two years ago , faced with the possibility of heavy losses on [ the stocks ] in their inventories , market makers themselves began dumping shares , exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices .
Mr. Tarantino of Hambrecht & Quist said some prices fell without trades taking place , as market makers kept dropping [ the prices ] at which they would buy shares .
Because Nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to pre-crash levels , traders and OTC market officials hope [ the damage ] wo n't be permanent .
[ The sellers ] on Friday came from all corners of the OTC market -- big and small institutional investors , as well as individual investors and market makers .
But grateful traders said [ the sell orders ] generally ranged from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares , compared with blocks of 500,000 shares or more two years ago .
`` If they could n't sell , some of them put [ the shares ] back on the shelf . ''
In addition , Mr. DaPuzzo said computer-guided program selling of OTC stocks in the Russell Index of 2000 small stocks and [ the Standard & Poor 's ] 500-stock Index sent occasional `` waves `` through the market .
The Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest nonfinancial issues , including [ the big OTC technology issues ] , tumbled 4.2 % , or 19.76 , to 449.33 .
[ The turnover ] in both issues was roughly normal .
On the OTC market , First Executive , a big buyer of [ the high-risk , high-yield issues ] , slid 2 to 12 1\/4 .
[ The key U.S. and foreign annual interest rates ] below are a guide to general levels but do n't always represent actual transactions .
`` I spent $ 30 million in [ the last half-hour ] . ''
Most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be [ the best-performing long-term investment ] , attracting about $ 1 trillion from pension funds alone .
`` The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders , and that they ca n't react to short-term events , good or bad , '' said Stephen L. Nesbitt , senior vice president for [ the pension consultants ] Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif .
Stocks , as measured by [ the Standard & Poor 's ] 500-stock index , have been stellar performers this year , rising 27.97 % before Friday 's plunge , excluding dividends .
Mr. Awad , however , worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in [ the next few days ] .
He said he discerns many parallels with 1987 , including [ the emphasis ] on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading .

In its severest test , [ the $ 60 billion ] of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected .
`` We got calls from big block houses asking us if we want to make bids on anything , '' said Mr. Weisman , who , happy with his returns on investments chalked up earlier , declined [ the offers ] .
Mr. Weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in [ the next few days ] before declining again , trapping more investors .
Especially gleeful were [ the short sellers ] , who have been pounded by this year 's market climb .
[ The shorts ] sell borrowed shares , hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price .
Food and Drug Administration spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the agency has turned over evidence in a criminal investigation concerning Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. to [ the U.S. Attorney 's ] office in Baltimore .
Bolar , the subject of a criminal investigation by the FDA and [ the Inspector General 's ] office of the Health and Human Services Department , only agreed to recall two strengths of its version of Macrodantin `` as far down as direct customers , mostly wholesalers , '' Mr. Nesbit said .
Bolar has denied that it switched [ the brand-name product ] for its own in such testing .
The West German retailer ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in [ the Netherlands ] .
Should [ the courts ] uphold the validity of this type of defense , ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV .
A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and [ the propriety ] of the preferred-share issue .
Politicians tried to finger each other for [ the blame ] , although many analysts doubt that Washington was singly responsible for Wall Street 's woes .
-- For [ the last two weeks ] , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy .
`` One of [ the things ] that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board , '' said Lawrence Kudlow , a Bear , Stearns & Co. economist , on ABC 's `` This Week . ''
But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta , who said a precipitous drop this week `` is going to force [ the president ] and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . ''
`` There is an underlying concern on [ the part ] of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- .
`` There is an underlying concern on the part of [ the American people ] -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- .
Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline to overcome [ the bitter feelings ] that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight .
Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with [ the deficit-reduction legislation ] .
At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was [ the president 's ] policy to include it .
When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from [ the legislation ] , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it .
Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling [ the House and Senate versions ] of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest .
Senate Republicans expressed [ the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit ] .
Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to [ the margins ] here . ''
No one in Washington was willing to take [ the blame ] for provoking Friday 's drop in the stock market .
Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , [ the supply-side chief economist ] of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains .
`` There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut , '' Sen. Mitchell said during his television appearance , `` but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of [ the others ] .
At the annual congress of [ the National Association of Investors Corp. ] at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Minneapolis , the scene was calm .
But Robert Showalter , an official of the association , said no special bulletins or emergency meetings of [ the investors ' ] clubs are planned .
He has four stocks in mind to buy if [ the prices ] drop to the level he wants .
Sara Albert , a 34-year-old Dallas law student , says she 's generally skittish about the stock market and [ the takeover activity ] that seems to fuel it .
When the little guy gets frightened , [ the big guys ] hurt badly .
Avner Arbel , a Cornell University finance professor , says government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to `` win back [ the confidence ] of the small investor . ''
`` These high rollers took a big bath today , '' he said in his showroom , which is within a few miles of [ the multi-million dollar homes ] of some of Houston 's richest citizens .
And , finally , there were [ the gloaters ] .
That ca n't be said of [ the $ 2,400 notepad computer ] introduced a few weeks ago by GRiD Systems Corp. , a unit of Tandy .
Atari Corp. 's Portfolio , introduced in Europe two months ago and in the U.S. in early September , weighs less than a pound , costs a mere $ 400 and runs on three AA batteries , yet has [ the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs ] .
At stake is what Mike Swavely , Compaq 's president of North America operations , calls `` the Holy Grail of the computer industry '' -- [ the search ] for `` a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere . ''
It also has precluded use of [ the faster , more powerful microprocessors ] found in increasing numbers of desktop machines .
[ The competitive sniping ] can get pretty petty at times .
A Poquet spokesman , for example , criticizes [ the Atari Portfolio ] because it requires three batteries while the Poquet needs only two .
A Poquet spokesman , for example , criticizes the Atari Portfolio because it requires three batteries while [ the Poquet ] needs only two .
Poquet , trying to avoid the `` gadget '' label , responded with the tag line , `` [ The Poquet PC ] -- a Very Big Computer . ''
Others undoubtedly will follow , but most analysts believe Compaq has at least a six-month lead on [ the competition ] .
Toshiba 's line of portables , for example , features [ the T-1000 ] , which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory , and the T-1600 , which also uses a 286 microprocessor , but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size .

Japan 's wholesale prices in September rose 3.3 % from a year earlier and were up 0.4 % from the previous month , [ the Bank ] of Japan announced Friday .
Ford Motor Co. said it acquired 5 % of [ the shares ] in Jaguar PLC .
Jaguar , the London Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are being notified of [ the transactions ] , the company said .
That 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance [ the collateral ] backing their loans .

A spokesman for Avis would n't specify [ the costs ] but said the three airlines being dropped account for `` far less than half '' of the total .
Robert D. Cardillo , Avis vice president of marketing , said , `` [ The proliferation and costs ] attached to -LCB- frequent-flier programs -RCB- have significantly diminished their value . ''
CBS insisted the move was n't a setback for the program , which is the network 's first entry into [ the late-night talk show format ] since 1972 .
The show , despite a promising start , has slipped badly in [ the weekly ratings ] as compiled by A.C. Nielsen Co. , finishing far below `` Tonight '' on NBC , a unit of General Electric Co. , and `` Nightline '' on ABC-TV , a unit of Capital Cities\/ABC Inc .
Further fractioning the late-night audience is [ the addition ] of the `` Arsenio Hall Show , '' syndicated by Paramount Communications Inc .
[ The results ] , which are in line with analysts ' estimates , reflect `` a continued improvement in our U.S. business , '' said James Treybig , Tandem 's chief executive officer .
Tandem expects to report [ the full results ] for the quarter next week .
Commenting on [ the results ] for the quarter , Mr. Treybig said the strength of the company 's domestic business came as `` a surprise '' to him , noting that sales `` in every region of the U.S. exceeded our plan . ''
The resulting decline in interest rates and [ the value ] of the dollar could reinvigorate American business -- indeed , the entire economy .
`` [ The market today ] has a life of its own , '' John Akers , chairman of International Business Machines Corp. , said Saturday .
Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage [ the foreign investors ] upon whom the U.S. now relies for financial sustenance .
But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , [ the beneficial effects ] of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate .
Tiny movements in the rate , which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans , are usually among [ the few visible tracks ] that the Fed leaves on the monetary markets .
Consumer spending did drop in [ the months ] following Black Monday 1987 -- `` but only slightly and for a short period of time , '' recalls Mr. Zarnowitz , a longtime student of business cycles .
The economy does , however , depend on [ the confidence ] of businesses , consumers and foreign investors .

Producers of commodity chemicals , [ the basic chemicals ] produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers , have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers .
[ Once the chief beneficiaries ] of the industry 's now fading boom , these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the 1988 third quarter .

[ The estimates ] for Du Pont range from $ 2.25 to $ 2.45 a share .
By some accounts on Wall Street and in the industry , [ the inventory reductions ] are near an end , which may presage firmer demand .
[ The projections ] are in the neighborhood of 50 cents a share to 75 cents , compared with a restated $ 1.65 a share a year earlier , when profit was $ 107.8 million on sales of $ 435.5 million .
Himont faces lower prices for its mainstay product , polypropylene , while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for polypropylene , whose markets include [ the packaging and automobile industries ] .
